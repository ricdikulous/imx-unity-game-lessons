# Lesson: Install Immutable Unity SDK

Welcome to the "Install Immutable Unity SDK" lesson. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of installing the Unity Immutable SDK into your Unity project. Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

**Git Large File Storage (git-LFS):** Some files in the Unity Immutable SDK are stored in Git Large File Storage. If you haven't already installed git-LFS, please follow the installation instructions at [link to git-LFS installation].

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, navigate to the [unity-immutable-sdk](https://github.com/immutable/unity-immutable-sdk) repository on GitHub. In the repository's README.md, you will also find instructions for installing the SDK.

Clone the repository by copying the repository link and running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/immutable/unity-immutable-sdk.git 
```

### 2. Open Your Unity Project

Next, navigate to your Unity project. If you don't have a project open, go ahead and open your Unity project workspace.

### 3. Access the Unity Package Manager

In the Unity editor, click on 'Window' in the top menu, and select 'Package Manager.'

### 4. Add the Immutable SDK Package

In the Unity Package Manager, click the 'plus' button in the top-left corner, and from the menu, select 'Add package from disk.'

### 5. Locate the SDK Package

In the dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you cloned the repository in step 1. Open the 'unity-immutable-sdk' folder, then 'source,' 'Packages,' 'Passport,' and select the 'package.json' file.

### 6. Load the Package

Unity will take a moment to load the package.

And there you have it! You've successfully installed the Unity Immutable SDK into your Unity project, and now you're ready to begin integrating the Immutable Passport into your game.

## Next Steps

With the SDK installed, you can proceed to the next lessons to learn how to integrate the Immutable Passport and unlock the full potential of your Unity game.
